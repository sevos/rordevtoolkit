RoRDevToolkit is a set of scripts dedicated to administrators, 
developers and testers. It makes preparing workstation easy.
Using few commands you can run script, which will automatically install 
everything you need for writing applications in Ruby and Rails.

    2. SUPPORTED DISTRIBUTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard recipes are written for Ubuntu and Fedora, but only Ubuntu recipes are 
completly tested on fresh Ubuntu 9.04 Desktop installation. 
RoRDevToolkit tries to detect your current distribution by finding distribution-
specific files such as "apt-get" or "yum". However, mechanism is not perfect, so
use it carefully. 
Depending on your current distribution it can switch on/off some tasks/steps.

Detecting module relays on config/distributions.rb file and sets current 
distribution value to one of keys coming from the hash in that file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3. REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First of all you need Ubuntu 9.04 or Fedora 11 (completly not tested on other
ditributions). There is something you need to do before you start using the 
tool:
    For Fedora:
      $  su -c "yum install ruby ruby-devel irb"
      $  su -c "gem install rake"
      $  ./rdt module:rubygems:install

    For Ubuntu:
      $  ./ubuntu.sh

These commands will install ruby interpreter and update rubygems.

    4. QUICK START
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard recipes allow to prepare a developer's desktop on your system.

There are two metapackages (bind many modules into one command):

    devel_studio:
        It install and configure common gems (like rails, mongrel or haml), 
        database server (postgresql) and GViM configured to work with rails.

    testing_studio:
        Installs testing environment: Celerity on JRuby (downloads and installs
        JRuby distribution), Cucumber, RSpec, Culerity.

To see all recipes just run:
    $ ./rdt -T

There are few recipes not included in metagems.

In addition application supports --no-ri and --no-rdoc flags. You can pass them
to rdt wrapper in order to force skipping generating documentation files for
all gems installed by running task, i.e.:
    $ ./rdt module:firebird:install --no-ri --no-rdoc

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    5. CUSTOM RECIPES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RoRDevToolkit looks for recipes in modules/**/*.rb recursively. Files should be 
written in ruby and have "rb" extension.
There is no limitation for supported distributions. 
In order to add support for certain distributions you need to go to 
config/distributions.rb file and add list of files describing your distribution.
In other way: If all files listed for some distribution will be present 
in the system it will be that distribution.

You can feel free to write own recipes. Built-in recipes can be threated 
as examples. Some documentation coming soon.
